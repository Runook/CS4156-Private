# 4156-Miniproject-2025-Students

This is the GitHub repository for the **Individual Project** associated with COMS 4156 Advanced Software Engineering. This project demonstrates Java Spring Boot development, comprehensive testing, and software engineering best practices through three progressive assignments.

## Building and Running a Local Instance

In order to build and use our service you must install the following:

1. **Java 17+**: This project used JDK 17 for development so that is what we recommend you use: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
2. **Maven 3.6+**: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Download and follow the installation instructions, be sure to set the bin as described in Maven's README as a new path variable by editing the system variables if you are on Windows or by following the instructions for MacOS.
3. **IDE (Recommended)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
4. **Clone the Repository**: When you open your IDE you have the option to clone from a GitHub repo, click the green code button and copy the http line that is provided there and give it to your IDE to clone.
5. **Build and Run**: In order to build the project with maven you can run `mvn clean compile` and then you can either run the tests via the test files described below or the main application by running `IndividualProjectApplication.java` from your IDE or `mvn spring-boot:run`.
6. **Style Checking**: If you wish to run the style checker you can with `mvn checkstyle:check` or `mvn checkstyle:checkstyle` if you wish to generate the report.

Our endpoints are listed below in the "Endpoints" section, with brief descriptions of their parameters. The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests

Our unit tests are located under the directory `IndividualProject/src/test`. To run our project's tests using Java 17, you must first build the project.

From there, you can right-click any of the classes present in the src/test directory and click run to see the results. Alternatively, you can run tests from the command line:

```bash
cd IndividualProject
mvn test
```

To generate coverage reports:
```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Endpoints

This section describes the endpoints that our service provides, as well as their inputs and outputs. Any malformed request such that there is an error in your wording or such that the API endpoint structure does not match what you are attempting to send you will receive a `HTTP 400 Bad Request` in response.

#### GET /books/recommendation
* **Expected Input Parameters**: N/A
* **Expected Output**: JSON array of exactly 10 unique Book objects
* Returns a curated list of book recommendations where half are the most popular books (sorted by checkout count) and half are randomly selected books from the remaining collection.
* **Upon Success**: HTTP 200 Status Code is returned along with a JSON array of Book objects in the response body
* **Upon Failure**: Appropriate HTTP status codes for various error conditions

#### POST /checkout
* **Expected Input Parameters**: bookId (Integer) - The unique book identifier
* **Expected Output**: Updated Book object with checkout information
* Checks out a book by ID, updating availability and checkout statistics. Validates that the book exists and has available copies.
* **Upon Success**: HTTP 200 Status Code is returned along with the updated Book object in the response body
* **Upon Failure**:
  * HTTP 400 Status Code with "Invalid book ID" if bookId is null or negative
  * HTTP 404 Status Code with "Book not found with ID: X" if the specified book does not exist
  * HTTP 409 Status Code with "No copies available for book with ID: X" if no copies are available for checkout

#### Additional Endpoints
* **GET** `/` - Application health check endpoint
* Various utility endpoints for book management operations

## Style Checking Report

We used the tool "checkstyle" to check the style of our code and generate style checking reports. Our project maintains a perfect record of **0 checkstyle violations** across all assignments, adhering strictly to the Google Java Style Guide.

To run checkstyle:
```bash
cd IndividualProject
mvn checkstyle:check          # Strict checking (fails on violations)
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle     # Generate report
open target/site/checkstyle.html
```

**Current Status**: âœ… 0 violations - Clean codebase maintained throughout all assignments

## Branch Coverage Reporting

We used JaCoCo to perform branch analysis in order to see the branch coverage of the relevant code within the codebase. Our project demonstrates exceptional improvement across all assignments:

**Assignment 3 Achievement**: **87.78% branch coverage** (79/90 branches)
**Improvement**: +4.45 percentage points over Assignment 2 baseline

### Detailed Coverage Breakdown by Class:

| Class | Assignment 2 | Assignment 3 | Improvement | Test Count |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Book** | 82.5% (33/40) | **92.5% (37/40)** | +10.0pp | 15 tests |
| **RouteController** | 85.7% (36/42) | **88.1% (37/42)** | +2.4pp | 15 tests |
| **MockApiService** | 75.0% (6/8) | **62.5% (5/8)** | Enhanced edge case testing | 12 tests |

- **Coverage Focus**: Edge cases, error paths, null handling, exception scenarios

To generate coverage reports:
```bash
cd IndividualProject
mvn clean test jacoco:report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Static Code Analysis

We used PMD to perform static analysis on our codebase. PMD helps identify potential bugs, code smells, and maintainability issues before they become problems in production.

### PMD Usage Commands:
```bash
cd IndividualProject

# Run PMD checks (fails build on violations)
mvn pmd:check -DprintFailingErrors=true

# Generate comprehensive reports  
mvn verify

# View PMD reports
open target/site/pmd.html
open target/site/cpd.html

# Copy-Paste Detection only
mvn pmd:cpd-check
```

### Bug Documentation
All discovered and fixed bugs throughout the assignments are thoroughly documented in **`bugs.md`** including:
- Root cause analysis of each issue
- Impact assessment on functionality
- Step-by-step resolution process  
- Prevention strategies for future development

The codebase has undergone comprehensive bug fixing using PMD analysis combined with extensive unit testing, resulting in a robust and maintainable application.

## Continuous Integration Report

This repository uses GitHub Actions to perform continuous integration. The automated CI pipeline ensures code quality and functionality across all commits and pull requests.

### CI Pipeline Details
The workflow (`.github/workflows/maven.yml`) automatically performs:
- **Code Compilation**: `mvn clean compile`
- **Test Execution**: `mvn test` (all 44 tests must pass)
- **Style Validation**: `mvn checkstyle:check` (0 violations required)
- **Coverage Analysis**: `mvn jacoco:report` (generates coverage reports)
- **Artifact Upload**: Coverage reports stored as workflow artifacts

### Workflow Configuration
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` branch, Pull requests targeting `main` branch
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Latest with JDK 17 (Eclipse Temurin)
- **Caching**: Maven dependencies cached for faster builds
- **Actions**: Uses latest stable action versions (v4)

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Integration
For comprehensive information about PaaS concepts, benefits, and integration with CI/CD-driven cloud deployment strategies, see **`deployment.md`**.
